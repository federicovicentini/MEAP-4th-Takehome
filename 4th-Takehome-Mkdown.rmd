phi <- 0.3
matrix <- matrix(0,2,2, dimnames=list(c("h","l"),c("h","l")))
matrix[1,] <- c(phi, (1-phi))
matrix[2,] <- c((1-phi), phi)
kable(matrix,   format = "pipe",
                row.names=TRUE, 
                col.names=c("h","l"))

beta <- 0.96
gamma <- 2
h <- 1.05
l <- 0.97
```

Now the exogenous endowment shock
is a two states Markov process, defined as:

$$\frac{\Omega_{t}}{\Omega_{t-1}}=\omega_{t}\quad 
  with \; \omega_{t}\epsilon (h,l)$$

With the following symmetric transition matrix:

$$\Pi = \left[\begin{matrix}\phi & (1-\phi) \\ 
                            (1-\phi) & \phi \\ \end{matrix}\right]$$

Let $\beta = 0.96$, $\gamma=2$, $h=1.05$, $l=0.97$ and $\phi=0.3$.

Knowing this, we cannot use the same 4-cases framework 
we've seen in class, as the probability of finding ourselves
in state h or state l now depends on the state of the economy in the
previous period.

Thus, we will have two different yield curves, conditional on the state
of the Markov process we are starting with at time t. Let's then compute
the yield curve for each of the two cases.

## CASE 1: (t = state h)

In this case, we start in h at time t, so the probability
matrix (at times $t+1$ and $t+2$) will look like this:

$$\left[\begin{matrix}\phi      & (\phi*\phi)+(1-\phi)*(1-\phi) \\ 
                      (1-\phi)  & \phi*(1-\phi)+(1-\phi)*\phi\\ 
        \end{matrix}\right]$$

Looking at the first column it's obvious that, since we find ourselves 
in $h$ at time $t$, in time $t+1$ we will be still in $h$ with probability
$\phi$ and we will switch to $l$ with probability $(1-\phi)$. 
Looking at the second column, we have to think about the ways through
which we could find ourselves in h at time $t+2$: either we were in $h$
at time $t$ and we remained there (probability equal to $(\phi*\phi)$) or 
we were in $l$ at time $t$ and we switched states (probability equal to 
$(1-\phi)*(1-phi)$). Summing the two probabilities we find the total probability
of finding ourselves in state $h$ at time $t+2$. The same exact
reasoning applies to the probability of finding ourselves in state $l$.


We can rewrite it as:


$$\left[\begin{matrix}\phi      & 2\phi^{2}+1-2\phi\\ 
                      (1-\phi)  & 2\phi(1-\phi)\\ 
        \end{matrix}\right]$$

Then, we compute the yield at time $t+1$ and $t+2$ using the following
code and the two equations:

$$y_{t+1}=-ln \left(\beta*\left(p_{1}(h)*(h)^{-\gamma} +
                                p_{1}(l)*(l)^{-\gamma}
              \right)\right)$$
$$y_{t+2}=-\frac{1}{2}ln \left(\beta^{2} 
                      \left(p_{1}(h) p_{2}(h) (h^{2})^{-\gamma} +
                            p_{1}(l) p_{2}(l) (l^{2})^{-\gamma} +
                            p_{1}(h) p_{2}(l) (hl)^{-\gamma} +
                            p_{1}(l) p_{2}(h) (lh)^{-\gamma}
              \right)\right)$$

We wanted also to have a measure of the short-term interest rate in 
period t. In the real world, this is the overnight interest rate, set
by the Central Bank. To make an approximation, we used the same equation
used for $y_{t+1}$ setting $p_{1}(h)=1$ since we know we are in $h$ at
time $t$. Also, $\beta$ has exponent $0$ so it is equal to $1$.
Thus, equation for our "short-term" interest rate is:

$$y_{t}=-ln \left((h)^{-\gamma}\right)$$

Let's look now at the code and the output:

```{r p2, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, dev="svg"}

#CASE 1: 
#In this case we find ourselves in h at time t

pi <- matrix(NA, 2,2)
pi[1,]=c(phi, 2*(phi)^2+1-2*phi)
pi[2,]=c(1-phi, (2*phi)-2*(phi)^2)

yt_1=-log(beta*(pi[1,1]*(h)^(-gamma)+pi[2,1]*(l)^(-gamma)))
yt_2=-0.5*log(((beta)^2)*(pi[1,1]*pi[1,2]*(h*h)^(-gamma) + 
                          pi[2,1]*pi[2,2]*(l*l)^(-gamma) + 
                          pi[1,1]*pi[2,2]*(h*l)^(-gamma) + 
                          pi[2,1]*pi[1,2]*(l*h)^(-gamma)))

yieldcurve=c(yt_1,yt_2)
plot(yieldcurve, type="o",  main="Yield curve with t = h",
                            xlab= "Time",
                            ylab= "Yield",
                            col="dark green")


yt_0=-log((h)^(-gamma))
yieldcurve=c(yt_0,yt_1,yt_2)
plot(yieldcurve, type="o",  main="Yield curve with t = h",
                            xlab= "Time",
                            ylab= "Yield",
                            col="dark green")

yieldcurve * 100

```

In this case, the yield curve starts at about $9.75\%$, then it presents
a downward slope going to $2.49\%$ in the second period (indicating the
high probability of a recession in $t+1$) and then going up again to a yield
of $4.68\%$ in $t+2$ (indicating the prediction of a recovery in the second
period).

We observe that even if the curve predicts a recovery in the long term, does
not return to the first-period yield level. We believe this is because 
in the starting period the state $h$ is certain, while in the second it is 
only slightly more likely than a recession (looking at our results, we have $58\%$
probability of being in the high state), thus the yield is lower.



## CASE 2: (t = state l)

In the second case the procedure remains exactly identical, but the
two rows of the probability matrix are inverted with respect to the first case.

So, we report below the code and the related plots:

```{r p3, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE, dev="svg"}

#CASE 2: 
#In this case we find ourselves in l at time t

pi2 <- matrix(NA, 2,2)
pi2[1,]=c(1-phi, (2*phi)-2*(phi)^2)
pi2[2,]=c(phi, 2*(phi)^2+1-2*phi)

yt_1l=-log(beta*(pi2[1,1]*(h)^(-gamma)+pi2[2,1]*(l)^(-gamma)))
yt_2l=-0.5*log(((beta)^2)*(pi2[1,1]*pi2[1,2]*(h*h)^(-gamma) + 
                          pi2[2,1]*pi2[2,2]*(l*l)^(-gamma) + 
                          pi2[1,1]*pi2[2,2]*(h*l)^(-gamma) + 
                          pi2[2,1]*pi2[1,2]*(l*h)^(-gamma)))

yieldcurve_l=c(yt_1l,yt_2l)
plot(yieldcurve_l, type="o",  main="Yield curve with t = l",
                              xlab= "Time",
                              ylab= "Yield",
                              col="red")


yt_0l=-log((l)^(-gamma))
yieldcurve_l=c(yt_0l,yt_1l,yt_2l)
plot(yieldcurve_l, type="o",  main= "Yield curve with t = l",
                              xlab= "Time",
                              ylab= "Yield",
                              col="red")


yieldcurve_l * 100
```


In this case, the yield curve starts at about $-6.09\%$, then it presents
an upward slope going to $8.88\%$ in the second period (indicating the
high probability of an expansion in $t+1$) and then going down again to a yield
of $6.58\%$ in $t+2$ (indicating the prediction of a recession in the second
period).

We observe that even if the curve predicts a recession in the long term, it does
not return to the first-period yield level. We believe this is because 
in the starting period the state $l$ is certain, while in the second it is 
only slightly more likely than an expansion (looking at our results, we have $58\%$
probability of being in the low state), thus the yield is naturally higher.

Note that in both cases the yield $y_{t}$ is practically a "fictional" one. In the first 
case, the yield is much higher than what we would typically see in the real world economy, since
we do not ever have the complete certainty of being in a high state of growth, thus the real yield is
going to be much lower. In the second case, the yield is much lower than what we would observe. 
Also, let's recall that in reality, these short-term interest rate are mandated by the CBs, not by
the market itself.


## Comment on both cases

We can observe that, even if the the only difference in the probability matrix
in the two cases are the inverted rows, the yields are not "inverted".
In fact, the yield curve of the first case is always below the one for the 
second case (excluding $y_{t}$).

```{r p4, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, dev="svg"}
plot(yieldcurve,  main= "Graph of both cases",
                  xlab= "Time",
                  ylab= "Yield",
                  col= "dark green",
                  type="o")
par(new=TRUE)
plot(yieldcurve_l,  col="red", 
                    type="o", 
                    main ="", 
                    xlab="", 
                    ylab="", 
                    axes=FALSE)
```

In fact, we cannot even state that the slope of the curve is the same in absolute value.
The two yield curves present different slopes, and we can motivate this by considering the fact
that, since we are dealing with a two-period framework, losing $3\%$ and then gaining $5\%$ (which
is the equivalent of ending up in $l$ and then going to $h$) does not result in the same
gains as the opposite path (gaining $5\%$ and then losing $3\%$). If we add to this the fact that
gains and losses are not equal in magnitude, we have a good explanation of why the two curves
behave in a different way.

# Plot yield curves 2020
```{r plot1, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
plot(NULL, xlim = c(0, nrow(data)), ylim = c(-1,1), type = "n", xaxt = 'n', xlab='Maturity', ylab="Rate")
lines( data$Spot, type = 'b', col = '#0077ff')

axis(1, at = 1:nrow(data), labels = rownames(data))

       col=c("#0077ff", "#ff00a2"), lty= 1:1, cex=1)
title("Yield curve at 2020")
```

The plot above represents the spot and forward yield curve in July 2020. The spot yield is entirely 
in the negative area of interest rate due to the APP of the ECB. Even the forward curve is negative
until the 8Y maturity. Indeed, In addition, the ECB enlarged the APP program to face the pandemic in the EU countries, 
lowering the yield curve in the short maturity.

The curves are upward-sloping after 3Y, and the forward rate premium becomes higher as
maturity increases. Suggesting that agents had been expecting the recovery of consumption at the pre-covid level,
a tightening in the monetary policy, and probably higher inflation rates.

Regarding the maturity before 3Y, the forward rate is above the spot rate, and both have negative slopes. 
Leading to the belief that the agents had incorporated a recession in the 3 years ahead. As Engstrom and Sharpe (2018)
find that a near-term negative spread may only predict recessions because it reflects 
the market's expectation that a contracting economy will induce the central bank to lower its policy rate.
Indeed, the nominal interest rate is driven by the following:

* $E(Inflation rates)$ -> inflation risk premium
* $E(Monetary policy)$ -> real rate risk premium

Hence, if investors see higher odds of a recession, the long-term inflation risk premium in Treasury bonds will fall.
In contrast, an increase in the recession probability would increase the real rate risk premium asked by agents. 
One interpretation can be that if investors see a greater risk of recession, they will attribute a higher value 
to short-term assets that they can quickly liquidate to finance spending on goods and services.
It seems reasonable because the covid had already broken out in July, and the prices incorporated 
the expectation of future covid measures that hinder consumption.

# Plot yield curves 2021

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
data[ ,1]    <- sp[277,]
data[ ,2]    <- fw[277,]
colnames(data) <- c("Spot", "Forward")
rownames(data) <- colnamess
data <- data.frame(data)
#plot first
plot(NULL, xlim = c(0, nrow(data)), ylim = c(-1,1), type = "n", xaxt = 'n', xlab='Maturity', ylab="Rate")
lines( data$Spot, type = 'b', col = '#0077ff')
lines(data$Forward, type = 'b', col = '#ff00a2')
axis(1, at = 1:nrow(data), labels = rownames(data))
legend("topright",legend=c("Spot", "Forward"),
       col=c("#0077ff", "#ff00a2"), lty= 1:1, cex=1)
title("Yield curve at 2021")
```

The plot above represents the forward and spot yield curves for different maturity quoted in July 2021.
Compared to the previous plot, the forward yield curve is steeper. Thus the forward risk premium is higher for each 
maturity than the last plot. A possible interpretation 
is that the agents had expected higher inflation, an increase in monetary tightening, asking for
a higher risk premium.
Regarding the slopes of the two curves, the forward rate slope is positive, greater in absolute values compared to one year before
ar reach maturity. While the slope of the spot yield curve is slightly negative until it comes to a minimum at 2Y, then it becomes positive.
This behaviour can be explained by an increase in the odds of a recession in a short-term span, and this can justify the negative slopes and the negative
forward risk premium before 2Y maturity.
While after the 2Y maturity, the slopes and the forward risk premium are positive, this hints that agents believe in
a positive state of the economy in the long run.
